/**
 * A scope around loads when cooking that indicates whether the loaded package is needed in game or not.
 * The default is Unexpected. Declare an FCookLoadScope to set the value.
 * 
 * If the package is marked as EditorOnly, that only suppresses the reference from the LoadPackage call.
 * The package can still be pulled into the cook by UsedInGame references from the AssetRegistry or by being
 * stored as an import in a cooked package.
 *
 * Packages that are declared in the AssetRegistry as an editoronly reference by the package that loads them
 * are implicitly marked as ECookLoadType::EditorOnly for that load, and do not need an explicitly declared
 * loadtype to be marked as EditorOnly.
 *
 * LoadTypes also apply to Startup packages, or packages loaded by systems without the load being owned by
 * a referencer package. EditorOnly still suppresses these packages (for that single load) from being added
 * to the cook, UsedInGame still forces them to be added. For Startup packages, marking the package as
 * EditorOnly both removes its auto-inclusion in the cook, and also removes the special chunk rule for startup
 * packages from it, if it ends up being pulled into the cook by another referencer. Startup packages are
 * automatically added to Chunk0 when the project is using multiple pak files (aka streaming chunks);
 * ECookLoadType::EditorOnly removes that chunk rule for the given package.
 *
 * This enum is declared in non-WITH_EDITOR builds to remove the need for #if WITH_EDITOR boilerplate, but
 * it is ignored; all of the functions/classes that use it are noops if !WITH_EDITOR.
