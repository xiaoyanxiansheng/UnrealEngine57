/**
 * Defines a Mixed Anim Target that animation pose-producing tracks can send pose-producing tasks to. 
 * Multiple pose producing tasks sent to the same target will be chained and mixed based on priority, pose weight, masks, and sequence hierarchy.
 * Inheriting from this struct allows the user to create new animation target types with their own metadata and custom component types.
 * Coupled with a custom component type, these mixer pose results can be read from a custom Movie Scene ECS system and passed as appropriate to an anim system.
 *  If no target struct is assigned, a default animation target will be assigned based on the makeup of the object being animated.
