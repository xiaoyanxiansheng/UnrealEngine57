	 * Storing a pointer to the UObject member variable only works in the AActor/UPrimitiveComponent case because:
	 *	UPrimitiveComponent's outer is its owning AActor, so it prevents the owner from being garbage collected while the component lives.
	 *  If the UPrimitiveComponent is GC'd during the Actor's lifetime, OwnerLastRenderTime is still valid so there is no issue.
	 *	If the UPrimitiveComponent and the Actor are GC'd together, neither will be deleted until FinishDestroy has been executed on both.
	 *	UPrimitiveComponent's FinishDestroy will not execute until the primitive has been detached from the Scene through it's DetachFence.
	 * In general feedback from the renderer to the game thread like this should be avoided.
