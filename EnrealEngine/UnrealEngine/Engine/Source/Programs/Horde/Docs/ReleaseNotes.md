* Add max retries to agent delete (45021946)
* Filter out anonymous pools in pools view (44988418)
* Cloud DDC - Sending parts as uniform object as the validation code on the C++ side prefers this (its a more optimal format of this object). Implemented a very explicit support for writing uniform objects, fixing so that the writer converts to uniform types if appopriate required a much more intrusive change. (44981589)
* Cloud DDC - Dispose of JsonDocument when converting CbObject to Json, was not aware it was disposable. Thank you static code analysis. (44981577)
* Cloud DDC - Job metadata field serialization fix (ObjectId types was not converted correctly to json). Removed 1 of the 2 json conversation paths we had as the one we now have did not have this issue. Also fixed issues with serializing Guids to cb object. Lastly this adds support from serializing a json object into a CbObject, there is quite a lot of type loss going to json so this is not perfect but its handy to have in tests. (44928734)

  Older tag "Horde_Autoscale_Pool" identifying by name will still work but should be considered deprecated. (44854631)

## 2025-08-14

  * Removed Shadow condition from filter to handle all cases (new blobs, shadow conversions, and updates)
  * Added tests for race conditions and concurrent shadow conversions (44788210)
* Remove unused setting for compute queue AWS metric in PoolConfig
  This has since long moved into a separate strategy - ComputeQueueAwsMetricStrategy. (44775313)

  Device tags are small bits of metadata that can be attached to each device
  When making a reservation, users can specify tags in a variety of ways
  Required Tags - Devices that do not have this tag will not be reserved
  Preferred Tags - Devices that have this tag will be selected over devices that do not, provided at least one is available
  Undesired Tags - Devices that have this tag will be de-prioritized over devices that do not
  Blocked Tags - Devices that have this tag will not be reserved (44669125)

## 2025-08-07

* Log an error when UAT terminates with a non-zero exit code
  The JobExecutor in the agent detects and flags job steps as failed when Unreal Automation Tool (UAT) terminates with a non-zero exit code. However, when inspecting job step logs, this failure is not immediately apparent because no explicit error messages were logged previously.
  This change adds an error log entry to make UAT failures more visible in the logs. (44661300)
* Escape redirect URI in OAuth login form for Horde accounts (44659453)
* Hydrate CachedCommitDoc objects created in fallback path (44597929)

* A node that is modified and skipped during a build graph update does not fail the whole build. If there is a modified node with a skipped state during a build graph update the whole graph would previously be marked as failed, instead allow the build to continue by marking dependent nodes as skipped/failed but still allow other independent subtrees to be run. (44273401)
* Update code coverage to use JetBrains.dotCover.CommandLineTools. The previuous code coverage tool JetBrains.dotCover.GlobalTool has been deprecated. (44273037)
* Horde Dashboard: Better handling of advanced additional arguments in NewBuildV2 (44207109)

* Added stream information to localization issues created by Horde (44002634)
* Renamed the telemetry entry for the Arguments field in the Job event. This is to fix a problem where the format was being processed incorrectly causing entries to appear as null. It feels unecessary to deprecate the old name as these fields are not in wide use yet and it's better to keep things clean and only write out data once rather than have duplicate data. (43869880)
* EpicGames.Perforce: Log if untracked files are removed (43864355)
* Add filtering to Build Health Card in Summary tab

* Horde :  Fix ScheduledDowntime GetNext to return next or active downtime
  If the downtime is active return the start and finish times for the active schedule.
  If the downtime is not active return the start and finish times for the next day or next week schedule.
  Downtime Service Tick ignores next times that are in the past, which is for downtime that are non-repeating. (43099696)
* Fixed an exception that was occuring in the LocalizationIssueHandler (43075154)
* [UBA] Fixed C# static analyzer error in SchedulerImpl.cs (43053139)
* [UBA] Changed UbaExecutor to use Uba's scheduler. Reason is to be able to implement shadow processes and also dynamically add more processes when things like llvm pgo wants to distribute internal processes.

* Disable trace level logging of agent channel data (42527178)
* Prevent per-cluster Perforce errors from aborting changelist replication loop.  With an invalid Perforce cluster or no available servers for that cluster, such an exception would bubble all the way up to the tick method. This lead to the replication loop restarting. (42483815)
* Update Remote Shader Compilation Horde docs with the new ini configuration. (42451263)
* Do not include steps with warnings in failed steps for job retries (42430419)

* Add a new workstation mode to agent
  * An agent in workstation mode is expected to authenticate as the current user, and not via a pre-shared token like in a buildfarm scenario
  * Uses interactive auth via EpicGames.Oidc to authenticate (41643324)
* Log reason when compute task allocation fails in compute client (41640994)
* Test case-insensitivity for pool ID when matching resources for compute cluster (41640817)
* Add pool ID argument to "compute run" in Horde CLI tool (41640803)
* Skip executing conform leases if agent is running in workstation mode
  Workstation agents only deal with stateless compute leases. (41640666)
* Fix Commits Viewer and Robomerge links not appearing in slack messages (41612887)
* Log server profile used during agent startup (41600533)
* Log type of lease being executed in agent (41600484)
* Stop disposing of supplied HTTP handler in HordeClient
  When enabling interactive auth for the Horde agent, this error came up as the handler was improperly disposed.
  This fix addreses that as lifetime should be managed by caller, in this case, the service provider/DI. (41569693)
* Allow only compute tasks to be scheduled on workstation agents (41565320)
* Add Horde's user claim when issuing JWT tokens for built-in Horde auth mode (41533085)

## 2025-04-10

* Run tests for experimental plugin in Dockerfile builds (41526895)
* Add agent property for opting out from server-initiated updates of agent software
  In the case of agent running on workstation, this ability allows for more control and avoids the agent process restarting itself. (41526788)
* Do not run matchers on partial json log line entries.
  This prevents us from trying to match unreliable log lines which were only partially written out e.g. due to the process crashing mid output. (41526045)
* Fixed warnings in LocalizationIssueHandler.cs (41525967)
* Improved Horde's LocalizationIssueHandler to get ready for many C++ localization warnings to change to structured logs (UE_LOGFMT) (41519652)
* Change GlobalConfig.PostLoad and IPluginConfig.PostLoad methods to async
  This is to allow, in the future, config's to use async APIs for example to fetch secrets.
  Some tests had setup in constructors changed these to use the TestInitialize attribute. (41483040)
* Make update session call more robust
  * Catch HttpRequestException in addition to RpcException
  * Implement exponential backoff starting at 1s (max 20s)
  * Increase max retries from 3 to 8
  * Improve logging slightly to explain attempt count and delay (41414189)
* Add topological sort of plugins by their dependencies to call the PostLoad Method in the correct order (41410626)
* Add admin claim resolution for Horde auth mode
  Admin claims are now properly resolved when users sign in using Horde auth mode, matching the existing behavior in OIDC/Okta auth handlers. (41410594)
* Replace display field with unit field for Horde Analytics, and add Bytes, BytesPerSecond, Seconds, and Percentage options (41366205)
* Display the year when not current to reduce confusion when looking at historical jobs (41362940)
* Improve data fetching error and surface network connection as likely cause on job page (41362331)
* Fix step ETA times sometimes being in the past (41355458)
* Add better indicator for inidividual data points in Horde Analytics (41352087)
* Oidc Token - Added ability to read encrypted oidc configuration from a url. Similar to the horde url but encrypted and not exactly the same configuration layout. Is intended to be able to replace the horde url as a more generic option. --AuthConfigUrl for OidcToken.exe
  This should also hopefully cover most of the cases for submitting a oidc-configuration.json into source control.
  Also added --ConfigPath as a way to explicitly set the path to oidc-configuration.json if redistributing this outside of the ue engine sync.
  Lastly I added source code generators for json serialization and configuration builder to enable AOT compilation of OidcToken (which is not used yet). This also fixes most trimming warnings. (41351365)
* Fix issue with artifacts not properly loading between step navigation (41327584)
* Set minimum value for the Package and Content charts in Horde Analytics to zero (41316971)

  Moved some reporting aroudn in Horde Analytics to accomodate the changes:
  Moved IoStoreChunks and VirtualAsset telemetry for Fortnite to the product specfic API in Horde Analytics.
  Moved the Fortnite specifc metrics for Packages from Engine to the Fortnite specifc metrics file and dashboard.
  Removed traces of product names from Engine metrics and dashboard. (41228862)
* Add Wine override setting to JobDriver
  Applies to all jobs executed by this driver process, and overrides the value set by JobOption (which is better used for per-job settings). (41198833)
* Aded Creative pack chunk metrics to Horde analytics (41196875)
* Use agent's self-reported tool ID for tool selection during upgrades
  Agents now send this information to provide correct hinting for what tool to use. For example multi-platform, self-contained, or even custom tools for workstation-based agents. (41193761)

* Cloud DDC - Fixed build warning from change 38567473 (38567875)
* Cloud DDC - Fixed an issue serializing a CbObject that was a part of a poco type. The collection of CbFields was picked up the serializer meaning the object was written as an array with fields (which is not valid json). (38567473)
* Add support for enumerating analytics metrics and providing multi-group filters (38551348)
* Improvements to analytics top/bottom N capture (38547327)

* Cloud DDC - Fixed an issue were the json converted value of a object id was a base64 blob instead of a hex encoded string as we normally do. (38540397)
* Cloud DDC - Fixed some issues when converting from a json object to a compact binary object in the builds api (38534145)
* Make OIDC scopes and mappings overridable
  - Due to .NET config only merging array entries when combining config sources, hardcoded OIDC defaults (scopes and claim mappings) cannot be overridden.
  - Added OidcAddDefaultScopesAndMappings flag to control whether defaults are applied (38440554)

* Fix regex in mongo log/config check to be more inclusive (38335134)
* Cloud DDC - Fixed build warnings with the newly added CbObjectId type (38332782)
* Cloud DDC - Added initial version of a build api, this is intended to be used by cooked output snapshots and unsync builds. Its practically very similar to how snapshots already work but with a added index of which blocks exists so that it can be queried from the server rather then rely on input of a previous build which should help make better choices that increases dedup. 
  This api also provides simple searching which is better then what we had for the DDC api (which just had enumeration under special circumstances) which is needed to identify which snapshot to use.
  Lastly I added support for ObjectId in C# as this isn't something we have needed before but is used within objects for this API (is a 12 byte identifier that is valid within a object but not globally unique, it is similar to a uuid type 4).
  The build store currently only supports Scylla and Memory implementations (e.g. no base cassandra or mongo) as we have concerns about those dbs ability to perform for this workload. (38329536)
* Fixed Localisation warnings to correctly add a filepath which can be used for identifying suspected CL's which caused the issue. (38329203)
* Fix issue with failed batches not being able to retry steps (38299359)
* Merging Horde changes up to CL 38271598. (38274254)

* Remove EC2 IMDS server availability check during startup (38123434)
* Fix an issue where blobs uploaded out of order can cause references to be dropped. Now creates a "shadow" blob info record for any referenced blobs that don't exist, and converts that to a regular record when data is sent. (38121174)
* Preserve type URLs in Protobuf messages for upgrades and conforms during serialization. (38119696)

* Ensure agent stopping state is reported to server (38085676)

## 2024-11-14

* Handle EndOfStreamException in RecvOptionalAsync. Treat EndOfStreamException same as zero bytes read, returning false to indicate no data available rather than propagating the exception. (38077833)
* Forward completion event to inner in IdleTimeoutTransport (38077823)
* Change back to 16 read tasks for batch reads from storage. (38057408)
* Set maximum size of channels used for buffering data read from storage. If part of this pipeline is particularly slow (eg. I/O, network, CPU), is can cause large backlogs of buffered data which can kill performance or cause machine instability. Applying some back pressure resolves the issue without any loss in performance. (38051395)

* Replace AesTransport with a new implementation. Uses random nonces for each message instead of a base nonce. Add TCP transport integration tests (37992625)
* Add parameter for controlling inactivity timeout for compute executions. For UBA-based compute tasks this value needs to be increased as CPU or I/O can at times get starved, leading to a timeout. (37960155)
* Job search improvements, link to related jobs from operations bar, step callout optimizations (37920079)
* Improve symbol indexing time; perform hash calculations in parallel, and upload aliases in smaller batches. (37898457)

* Include a flag in template responses indicating whether the user can run it. (37792772)
* Show steps with issues inline when there is a label selected (37791398)
* Fix PerforceServiceCache.SubscribeAsync() stalling out when more than 10 commits are parsed in a single iteration, due to changes being enumerated in the incorrect order. Now uses a custom query to search for commits in the correct order, and only uses cached commit metadata. (37790919)
* Add flag for registering agent for uninstall in Windows. If the agent is installed via Unreal Toolbox but later uninstalled via Windows add/remove programs, Toolbox won't be notified. Until the uninstall command can be routed through Toolbox, this flag prevents Windows from handling uninstallation directly. (37743944)

* Show logs event data as generating for running steps when missing (37125109)
* Always show the reason for why compute resources may not be available (37114936)
* Do not retry HTTP requests which throw an HttpRequestException. These generally represent a non-transient error, unlike HTTP status responses. In the case of bad server addresses or ports, requests may take a long time to timeout. Retrying them does not make sense, and creates very long delays before the result is reported. (37093049)
* Cloud DDC - Changed server timing metrics into a concurrent bag instead of list with locks to reduce lock time a bit. (37085986)
* Fix for calling Remote UFUNCTIONs from other Remote UFUNCTIONs. (37066038)

* Grant claims to leases identifying them as running certain projects, streams, and templates. (36807664)
* Support running jobs in streams that do not have the engine directly under the stream root. The "EnginePath" property in the stream config can be used to configure the path to the engine folder. (36804827)
* Include a Version.json file in Unreal Toolbox builds which can be used to detect upgrades/downgrades. When auto-updating from builds with this file, only upgrades will be allowed. (36789633)
* Unreal Toolbox: Always show the settings dialog on launch unless the -Quiet argument is passed on the command line. This makes a more sensible default than requiring a -Settings argument. (36785739)

* Add filter for agent properties in REST API (36563629)
* Re-add logical cores as an agent property. UBA uses this property for determining number of agents to allocate. (36532400)
* Rename sample stream project to 5.5, and add a ugs-pcb artifact type. (36508675)
* Fix path for constructing Azure storage backends. (36508415)
* Move agent sandbox to be independent of agent settings, not in a hidden folder, and to avoid tripping path length warning by default (36505143)
* Fix issue with conform threshold for workspaces not propagating (36502791)

## 2024-09-19

* Expose .NET runtime version in agent properties (36427479)
* Add a separate build of the Horde Agent MSI for the toolbox, which includes metadata for running the installer. (36425974)
* Remove tray app and idle behavior setting from agent installer (36410206)
* Add support for group and platforms to bundled tools, adjust the build accordingly (36407524)
* Rename HordeToolbox again. Now: "UnrealToolbox!" (36401901)
* Add a dedicated installer for the tray app, and include it in the server installer. (36394095)
* Fix infinite loop issue when querying for jobs (36392029)
* Fix bug where physical cores are counted twice in capability detection (36387918)
* Replace OpenTracing with OpenTelemetry in JobDriver (36386025)
* Document the location of the server config file. (36384366)
* Ensure all streams register default artifact types.  We recently introduced the requirement that artifact types are explicitly configured (CL 35531333). The job driver expects certain artifact types to be present, and jobs will fail if these types are not registered.  This issue affects new installations and older installations upgrading to 5.5. (36383858)
* Remove OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore from agent (36383393)
* Add an option for automatically updating tools in the tray app. (36356951)
* Fixed a bug where issues would have their FixCommitId set to 0 rather than cleared after re-assignment to a new owner.  Note we set fixChange to 0 in the onAssign function in IssueViewV2.tsx.  I now check whether fixChange is == 0 and if so set FixCommitId to be empty, this causes the FIX CL to be cleared. (36345723)
* Add information about processes with a file locked when it cannot be overwritten when extracting data from a bundle. (36341246)
* Add a dataflow graph with multiple deletion workers to improve GC performance. (36340210)
* Upgrade Horde Agent to NET 8. (36340066)
* Add an exponential pause between iterations over the GC tick queue. This should reduce the time that we spend idle during blob deletion. (36321827)
* Fix changes not being enumerated in descending order by PerforceService, causing the minimum changelist number for ICommitCollection.SubscribeAsync() not being updated. This prevents issue fixed tags from being processed. (36321198)
* Add missing file. (36318745)
* Replace OpenTracing with OpenTelemetry in agent (36307242)
* Move OpenTelemetry settings to EpicGames.Horde for sharing with agent (36303013)
* Added an additional sanitise case for the PerforceMetadataLogger when trying to get file annotations.  We could potentially handle this in LogEventParser AddLine but I wanted to limit the impact of these changes. (36299319)
* Add a proxy server to the Horde tray app, allowing users to connect to the Horde server via an unauthenticated connection bound to localhost. (36292016)
* Add a flag for showing a tool in the Horde tray app. (36284430)
* Add settings menu to tray app, as well as functionality for downloading tools from Horde. (36265467)
* Handle .horde.json file not existing when configuring server url on Mac/Linux. (36264830)
* Changed code traversing workspace on disk to use EnumerateFileSystemInfos instead of directories and files separately. This reduces number of kernel calls and save 20% time on a machine with attached ssd (36149765)
* Add timeouts for available port checking in tests (36117480)
* Add server-defined properties for an agent
  - Allows setting properties that will overwrite and merge with properties reported by agent itself
  - Refactor parameters for agent creation into an options object
  - When a user/agent can create new agents outside enrollment process, it's marked as trusted for the time being (grandfathering existing registration in JobRpcService) (36114930)
* Ignore server-defined properties when sent by agent (36108891)
* Adding Horde installer custom actions, data directory selector, and fix server to be able to bootstrap using custom data directory (36082966)
* Add tooltips for step times (36043646)
* Additional logging for terminating sessions. (36041396)
* Set the max thread count for managed workspace operations to one less than the number of reported CPUs on the machine. (36038061)
* Add better error for failing to start a process from the Horde Agent. (36026676)
* Advertise a new OSFamilyCompatibility property from agents, indicating OSes that the system can emulate (for Linux agents with WINE to indicate Windows compatibility). (36018324)
* Allow specifying a list of properties required for agents to execute compute leases. (36012503)
* Re-enable dedupe for the tools bundled with Horde. The permissions affecting access to this data are now waived for bundled tools. (36012474)
* Fix installed server not correctly identifying code changes correctly. Server was incorrectly setting a flag indicating that all files for a change had been enumerated, preventing it scanning the entire set. (35977472)
* Add a symbol store plugin. Symbol stores use aliases in the storage system to map symbol store paths onto content streams from existing artifacts, allowing reuse of data already available in artifacts.
  - Symbols can be tagged with the appropriate metadata by setting the Symbols=true attribute on the CreateArtifact task. Referencing the namespace that the symbols will be uploaded to from the symbol store config will allow accessing them through the api/v1/symbols route.
  - Hashing for symbols is compatible with symstore.exe, but is handled by a custom implementation in SymStore.cs. (35971584)
* Fix linq expression for generation of alias index. (35967893)
* Pause the addition of new blobs for GC once the queue is longer than 50,000 entries. (35967249)
* Allow graceful draining of leases when yielding to local user activity
  - The termination signal file used for spot interruptions is now written to let a workload know about the lease being drained.
  - This requires workload to scan and respect the file for this to be effective, which UBA does for example. (35962694)
* Add agent version to compute resource class, used for exposing version in compute resource API. (35954995)
* Log Horde server and agent version for a UBA session (35954941)
* Fix name of aliases over blobs collection. (35950154)
* Remove code to read imports from uploaded blobs. These should now be set at upload time. (35949781)
* Support loading artifacts out of log which are not in the step artifacts (35931864)
* Improve issue button rendering to not obscure the structured logging eyeball, also change where we render the structured log (35931043)
* Include artifacts created through the CreateArtifact BuildGraph task in the list of artifacts for the job. (35924757)
* Catch compute cancellation exceptions and avoid flagging them as errors (35923687)
* Guard against socket errors during closing of compute socket, also ensure CloseAsync can't be invoked twice. (35903197)
* Set the UE_HORDE_STREAMID environment variable containing the current stream id when running under Horde. (35900707)
* Document the look up of P4TRUST file (35892976)
* Change tray app to use Avalonia rather than Winforms. (35883986)
* Dashboard side of bundled tool management (35877843)
* Add clear conform to agent context menu (35877280)
* Adding bundled information to tool responses (35876724)
* Fix broken ServiceAccountAuth test (35876245)
* Add name field to service accounts and use that in audit logs, previously, name of service accounts resolved to "unknown". (35873276)
* Keep track of the agents which are currently able to execute sessions.  Each server now caches the state of a session based on the last update time, allowing it to perform most operations with minimal context fetches in the common case where an agent is always being updated on the same server. (35872405)
* Fixed issue in recent UHT changes that prevented errors begin generated from the header file object. (35863940)
* Add agent settings for CPU count and multiplier.  Only provided as hinting to workloads, which can chose to respect these. The initial use-case is letting UBA limit number of CPUs in use, much how maxcpu/mulcpu works for UBT.  Later on these values could configure job objects (on Windows) for proper OS-enforced CPU limiting. (35861968)
* Document use of ssl: prefix for connecting to Perforce servers (35859151)
* Replace NuGet package with more explicit one to reduce dependency size (35822082)
* Fix description and creation time not being deserialized as part of artifact responses correctly. (35811531)
* Store session state in Redis rather than MongoDB. (35780092)
* Add HordeHTTPClient GetUgsMetadataAsync method (35775820)
* Fixed symbol table lookup to properly include the header file when walking up the outer chain. (35773746)
* Agent enrollment improvements (35770720)
* Add REST API endpoint for listing ACL permissions for current user (35770032)
* Fix invalid dep injection of ServerSettings in JwtHandler (35769300)
* Show permissions for ACL scopes on account page, useful for debugging permissions in Horde. (35768929)
* Improve OIDC configuration experience
  - Add debug mode for better explaining why a JWT bearer token is rejected
  - Validate required settings are set for auth mode OIDC/Okta
  - Improve docs for OIDC settings (35768735)

## 2024-08-22

* Lock fluent to fix upstream regression (35716215)
* Add customizable landing pages (35713203)
* Surface when log data is missing in log event (35712179)
* Address additional artifact search feedback (35710162)
* Make it more clear when a step was canceled by Horde vs a user (35709294)
* Add lock around invoking nftables CLI tool (35690511)

## 2024-08-19

* Add ability to override agent's compute IP used for incoming connections (35621653)
* Generate issues for completed job steps asynchronously. (35601740)
* Randomize port assignment for relay port mappings. There's a worry of re-using the same port leads to potential races with how nftables/conntrack cleans up entries. In previous impl, lowest available port number was always used which led to higher contention. (35594027)
* Check for invalid AWS region names in config (35589406)
* Allow configuring the namespace for artifact types, tools, and replicated Perforce data. (35568444, 35568869, 35570127)
* Skip expiration of artifacts if no retention policy is specified. Previous behavior was to purge all that weren't explicitly kept. (35543239)
* Add ushell to Horde installer. (35541567)
* Fix registration of bundled tools in installed builds. (35538391)
* Require artifact types to be declared in config files. Also allow setting expiration policies per-project and per-stream, and handle expiration of artifact types in deleted streams or of a type which are no longer declared. (35531333)
* Improve lease termination handling during AWS spot interruptions. Only terminate session once a lease has finished. (35529116)
* Ensure resolved issues are excluded from queries when resolved by timeout. (35449290)
* Fix rendering of message templates containing width and format specifiers. (35446849)

## 2024-07-29

* Fix changelist number not being returned in artifact responses. (35140759)
* Change artifact paths to Type/Stream/Commit/Name/Id, to reflect permissions hierarchy. (35129994)
* Add extension methods to allow extracting IBlobRef<DirectoryNode> directly into directories. (35094979)
* Preliminary support for VCS commit ids that aren't an integer. All endpoints still support passing changelist numbers for now. (35091676)

## 2024-07-25

* Add a separate flag for marking an issue as fixed as a systemic issue, rather than having to pass a negative value as a fix changelist. Still supports passing/returning negative fix changelists as well for now, but will be removed in future. (35029295)
* Serialize config for pool size strategies and fleet managers as actual json objects, rather than json objects embedded in strings. Supports reading from json objects embedded in strings for backwards compatibility. (35026676)
* Set output assembly name for the command line tool to "Horde". (34984531)
* Separate out log event errors and critical failures into a separate fingerprint when we exceed the 25 event limit in the Hashed Issue Handler. (34930826)
* Add support for tagging log events with issue fingerprints. The $issue property on a log event can contain a serialized IssueFingerprint, which will be parsed by the ExternalIssueHandler handler inside Horde. This property can be added from C# code using the ILogger.BeginIssueScope() extension method. (34913930)
* ParentView is optional per perforce documentation. Fixes Unhandled Exception (Missing 'ParentView' tag when parsing 'StreamRecord') for streams that does not have it set (34890081)

## 2024-07-16

* Support for disabling conform tasks through the build config file. (34836886)
* Allow setting access permissions for different artifact types on a per-type, per-project and per-stream basis. (34836758)
* Allow specifying a secondary object store to read objects from, allowing a migration from one store in the background without causing downtime. (34828731)

## 2024-07-15

* Split server functionality into plugins. Plugins are still currently statically configured, which will be changed in future. (34620916, many others)
* Fix threading issue causing block cache to always attempt to access element zero, causing tests to get stuck in an infinite loop. (34759616)
* Add a debug endpoint for writing memory mapped file cache stats to the log. (34757974)
* Fix resource leaks for blob data reads. (34756957, 34757889)
* Fix tracking of allocated size in MemoryMappedFileCache. (34747643)
* Fix binding of plugin server config instances. (34745408)
* Move build functionality into a plugin. (34744727)
* Respect Forwarded-For header for client's IP during compute cluster ID resolving. Also return a better error message when no network range or cluster is found. (34743435)
* Add support for automatic computer cluster assignment in Horde, based on internal and external IP. (34734153)
* Add endpoint for resolving a suitable compute cluster ID (34706120)
* Set agent property if Wine executable is configured. Needed for scheduling Wine-compatible compute tasks. (34675604)
* Do not log cancellation exception as a warning when checking if blob exists. (34672928)
* Remove legacy artifacts and log system. (34663531)
* Resolve HTTP client IP for Datadog trace enricher (34644555)
* Fix user ID/username not getting set in Datadog enricher for OpenTelemetry traces. Must be accessed once response has been sent. (34636046)
* Support for artifact searches (34605400)
* Log each configuration source during agent start for better visibility where the agent is reading config from. Also log the actual logs dir. (34603382)
* Log where agent registration file is saved to/loaded from. When the file exists, the agent provides no hinting it reads this file which can be confusing when trying to reset the agent. (34600505)
* Add documentation for setting up a secret store. (34569155)
* Add support for compression of all responses using gzip, brotli, and zstd. (34565711)
* Add creation time to artifact responses. (34559619)
* Change config reader to operate on JsonNode instances rather than writing directly into target objects. (34546472)

## 2024-06-20

* Compute a digest for each block stored in the block cache, and validate it before returning values. (34515388)
* Remove requirement to specify a stream or key to enumerate artifacts. (34513227)
* Downgrade log event about duplicate build products to information, since we don't have the list of duplicate build products to ignore in Horde. (34481396)
* Exclude blocks for empty files from the Unsync manifest. (34464454)
* Add IPoolSizeStrategyFactory interface, which is used for creating IPoolSizeStrategy instances. This allows us to remove the graph/job/stream collection interfaces from FleetService, allowing it to exist without any job handling code in the solution. (34457658)
* Do not shutdown disabled agents by default. Prior to this change, this value defaulted to 8 hours which assumes you want this behavior in the first place. Making this nullable allow for opt-in instead. (34455677)
* Remove tracing span from shared tickers. For long-running callbacks, this can create data which is difficult for Otel/DD to handle. (34444738)
* Add a debug endpoint which streams a random block of data to the caller. Usage is: /api/v1/debug/randomdata?size=1mb (34426596)

## 2024-06-17

* Add support for auto-assigning cluster ID during compute allocation requests (34423910)
* Increase MongoDB client wait queue size from 300 -> 5000 (34423018)
* Allow specifying cache sizes using standard binary suffixes (eg. "4gb") (34382251)
* Add the shutdown timeout for Kestrel server (34379789, 34379660)
* Add an AWS parameter store secret provider (34379595)

## 2024-06-13

* Add a pipelined blob read class for storage blobs. (34322019)
* Add a disk-based cache for compressed Unsync blocks. Uses memory mapped files to read/write to underlying storage, LRU eviction via random sampling. (34288152, 34292867)
* Tweak MongoDB client's config defaults to curb wait queue full errors (34276157)
* Resolving of capabilities has been known to stall at times. Adding trace spans to these should help see which part is causing slowdowns. (34232453)
* Add zstd as a compression format for bundles. Also add some basic compression tests, and fix an isuse with gzip streams being truncated. (34211536)
* Include rolling hashes in bundle archives to support unsync manifests. DirectoryNode/ChunkedDataNodeRef now use HordeApiVersion for versioning purposes, rather than their own custom versioning scheme. These blob types will serialize the most relevant Horde API version number they support into archives. (34207581)
* Ignore cancellations in AWS instance lifecycle (34207087)
* Include modification times for file entries in bundles by default, but do not write them unless the configured API version allows it. (34205938)
* Add compute endpoint that automatically finds the best cluster. Currently uses IP of requester together with networks from global config. (34201862)
* Fix some artifacts not showing up in job responses, due to default cap of 100 artifacts returned. (34200332)
* Check agent's compute cluster membership on assignment. Previously it was only checked by the task source. (34199317)
* Set user ID in compute assignment request track usage by user (34195976)
* Disable config updates when running locally in Redis read-only mode, preventing an exception on startup. (34169346)
* Make horde chunk boundary calculation consistent with unsync, add unit tests to validate determinism (34168267)

## 2024-06-06

* Add a retry policy to the Epic telemetry sink, to stop 502 errors causing server log entries. (34141477)
* Add a GC verification mode, which sets a flag in the DB rather than deleting an object from the store. (34135143)
* Fix issue where files will not be uploaded to temp storage if they were previously tagged as outputs in another step. Now allows output files to be produced by multiple steps, as long as their attributes match. (34132683)
* Adding support for optional cancellation reasons for jobs and steps (34131480)
* Forward all claims for access tokens minted for Horde accounts The role claim was missing which is used for resolving many permissions. (34119849)
* Log reasons when a lease is terminated due to the cancellation token being set. (34111700)
* Add a link to the producing job to .uartifact files, as well as other metadata and keys on the artifact object. (34095063)
* Allow user configured backends and namespaces to override the defaults in defaults.global.json. (34092465)
* Print a message to the batch log whenever a lease is cancelled or fails due to an unhandled exception. (34084201)
* Add a setting ("ReportWarnings") to exclude issues which are only warnings from summary reports. (34078316)
* Fix P4 server health not being updated when HTTP health check endpoint returns degraded. (34077493)
* Re-encode json log events which are downgraded from warning to information level. (34066649)
* Add more trace attributes to compute resource allocation (34064620)
* Record endpoint address in MongoDB command tracer, jelps differentiate between primary and secondary use (read-only ops) (34063808)
* Use cached agent data for JobTaskSource, this ticks every 5 seconds refreshing agent and pool data. The cached agent data is refreshed at the same rate. (34062377)

## 2024-05-31

* Use cached agent data for fleet and pool size handling (34029489)
* Fix conform commands using the incorrect access token to communicate with the server. (34012793)
* Allow registering multiple workspace materializer factories. (34010953)
* Add an agent document property for the combined list of pools, and upgrade existing agent documents on read to include it. This allows indexed searches for dynamic pools. (34009396)
* Add a log enricher which adds the server version. (34003927, 34005245, 34004705)

## 2024-05-30

* Update test projects to NET 8. (34002443)
* Refactor WorkspaceInfo to avoid keeping a long-lived connection. Keeping idle connections to the Perforce server after the initial workspace setup is unnecessary and wastes server resources. (33949575)
* Log in to the server when querying for config files from Perforce. (33945114)
* Fix http auth handler not using correct configuration for server when run locally. (33940162)
* Skip cleaning files for AutoSDK workspace. (33858727)
* Only enable debug controllers if enabled in settings (33857362)
* Add a fingerprint description as part of issue response (33833567)
* EpicGames.Perforce: Fix parsing of array fields from Perforce records. (33807413)
* EpicGames.Perforce: Fix parsing of records which have duplicate field names in child records. (33804970)
* Allow overriding the targets to execute for a job. The optional 'Targets' property can be specified when creating a job, and will replace any -Target= arguments in the command line if set. (33799426)
* Pass -Target arguments to individual steps to ensure that BuildGraph can correctly filter out which blocks to embed in temp storage manifests. (33799034)
* Remove server OS version info from anonymous endpoint responses. (#11909) (33793366)
* Allow overriding the driver for jobs through the JobOptions object. (33791494)
* Prevent AWS status queries from causing session update failures. (33782757)
* Move job driver into a separate executable. (33775640, 33782224)

## 2024-05-20

* Add grouping keys and platforms to tools. Intent is for the dashboard to only show one tool for each grouping key by default (the one with the closest matching platform based on the browser's user-agent), but users can manually expand the list of tools to show other platforms if desired.
  Platforms should be NET RIDs, eg. win-x64, osx-arm64, etc... (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog). (33698418)
* Use native GrpcChannel instances for agent connection management, rather than IRpcConnection. (33660725, 33638856)
* Add an AdditionalArguments property to jobs, which can be used to append arbitrary arguments to those derived from a job's parameters. This field is preserved - but not appended - to the arguments list if arguments are specified explicitly. Needs hooking up to the dashboard. (33630321)
* Prevent default parameters being appended to jobs when an explicit argument list is specified. (33628649)
* Move Perforce/BuildGraph functionality into a new Horde.Agent.Driver application. Intent is to separate this from the core Agent application over time, making it easier to iterate on Job/BuildGraph related functionality outside of the core agent deployment. (33606684)
* Move settings for different executors into their own files. (33605105)
* Trap exceptions when parsing invalid workflow ids from node annotations. (33602812)
* Enable HTTP compression for server-sent responses (33600392)
* Add support for agent queries via replica read (33575058)
* Optimize agent assignment for compute tasks by filtering by pool (33488689)
* Add command-based tracer for MongoDB. Old tracer operates at the collection level, this instead listens for events emitted by the Mongo client. (33479889)
* Keep a cached list of current agents in AgentService (33454500)
* Add an explicit error when the server URL does not have a valid scheme or host name. (33427628)
* Move expired and ephemeral agent clean up to shared ticker (33424708)

## 2024-05-01

* Explicitly check that the expiry time is set when searching for refs to expire, so that DocDB will use an indexed query. (33367777)
* Add CheckConnectionAsync to HordeHttpClient. (33353008)
* Add an index to the refs collection to prevent collection scans when finding refs to expire. (33338629)
* Reduce how long ephemeral and deleted agents are kept in database. Heavy use of auto-scaling can lead to excessive history of ephemeral agents being kept. In the case of AWS, each new instance has a unique agent ID. Many of the queries for agents (and in turn indices) are not optimized for a large collection. (33317167)
* Disable file modified errors in job executor. (33299280)
* Remove legacy job methods from horde_rpc interface. (33298879)
* Remove support for legacy artifact uploads. (33298589)
* Enable agents sending CPU/RAM usage metrics to the server. (33290135, 33289584)

## 2024-04-25

* Allow setting project-wide workspace types. Will automatically be inserted to the workspace type list of each stream belonging to the project. This also allows defining base types which can be inherited from. (33213109)
* EpicGames.Perforce: Fix errors parsing change views from labels. (33207649)
* Delete step logs when deleting a job. (33206294)
* Use the shared registry location to configure the Horde command line tool on Windows, and use a .horde.json in the user folder on Mac and Linux. (33205861)
* Rename step -> job step, report -> job report, batch -> job batch in job responses. (33191560)
* Include graph information in job responses. (33189353)
* Add a service to expire jobs after a period of time. Jobs are kept forever by default, though this may be modified through the ExpireAfterDays parameter in the JobOptions object in streams or projects. (33109364)
* Add auto conform for agents with workspaces below a certain free disk space threshold (33102671)
* Use a standard message for server subsystems that are operating normally. (33100047)
* Add min scratch space to workspace config (33098369)
* Recognize tags in Perforce changelists of the form '#horde 123' as indication that a change fixes a particular issue. The specific tag can be configured in the globals.json file to support multiple deployments with the same Perforce server. (33089498)
* Clear the default ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS environment variable in Docker images to prevent warnings about port overrides on server startup. We manage HTTP port configuration through Horde settings, and don't want the NET runtime image defaults. (33072683)

## 2024-04-18

* Add dashboard's time since last user activity to HTTP log (33068679)
* Fix agent registration not being invalidated when server is reinstalled. Server returns "unauthenticated" (401) response, not "forbidden" (403). Forbidden is only returned when the server deliberately invalidates an agent. (33060431)
* Send DMs to individual users rather than the notification channel when config updates succeed. (33060054)
* Prevent hypens before a period in a sanitized string id. (33044611)
* EpicGames.Perforce: Fix parsing of records with multiple arrays. (33038480)

* Refactor API message names, project locations and reduce gRPC dependency (32785690, 32783652)
* Allow clients to upload the list of references for each blob, removing the need for the server to do it later. (32768299)

## 2024-04-05

* Handle socket shutdown errors gracefully rather than throwing exceptions. (32756972)
* Add log message whenever native P4 connection buffer increases in size above 16mb. (32751407)
* Prevent log appearing empty if tailing is enabled but no new data has been received before the existing tail data is expired. Rpc log sink was waiting forever for new log tail data, so server was discarding the data already received. (32749401)
* Fix default settings for the analytics dashboard, and update documentation to specify the correct telemetry store name. (32741193)
* Update derived data for issues when they are closed by timeout. (32733991)
* Explicitly set parent context for telemetry spans in Perforce updates, to work around async context mismatches. (32732888)
* Rework commit metadata replication to run a single task for each replicated cluster, for a simpler code flow and better tracing data. (32730286)
* Instrument JobTaskSource ticker. We see occasional slow downs in agent assignment for jobs. Adding some additional tracing should help see what's causing it. (32727003)
* Do not assign compute resource to same machine as requester (32723450)

## 2024-04-01

* Doc updates. (32595767)
* Comment out the placeholder ticket value in the default config file. (32585713)
* Improve ordering of nodes when writing large file trees to storage, such that the nodes which are read after each other are adjacent in the storage blobs. Nodes are read in the reverse order to which they are written, depth-first. Arranging nodes in the blob in this order prevents thrashing of the cache and improves performance. (32585474)

## 2024-03-28 (UE 5.4 Release)

* Remove /userinfo call when authenticating via JWT. If an access token is passed, it's not guaranteed it has permission to access /userinfo from OIDC. ID tokens during normal web-based login does on the other hand. (32539012)

* Allow configuring different telemetry stores for each project and stream. (32460547)
* Fix slow queries in storage service garbage collection. (32460451)
* Add a [TryAuthorize] attribute which attempts authorization, but which does not return a challenge or forbid result on failure. Should fix tool download requests using service account tokens. (32447487)
* Fix OIDC issues when using Horde auth with UBA. (32406994)

## 2024-03-21

* Lower log level of failed AWS instance start (32397273)
* Assume any exceptions while checking for config files being out of date as meaning they need to be read again. (32388229)

* Invalidate the current session when deleting an agent from the farm. (32212590)
* Invalidate registrations with a server if creating a session fails with a permission denied error. (32212298)
* Fix job costs displaying for all users. (32154404)
* Expose the bundle page size as a configurable option. Still defaults to 1mb. (32153263)
* Use BitFaster.Caching for the LRU bundle cache. (32153088)
* Pool connections in ManagedWorkspace rather than creating a new instance each time. (32144653)
* Exclude appsettings.Local.json files from publish output folders. (32140083)

## 2024-02-29

* Add a back-off delay when RPC client gets interrupted in JsonRpcLogSink (31881762)
* Add a manual approval process for agents joining the farm. New EnrollmentRpc endpoint allows agents to connect and wait for approval without being assigned an agent id or being able to take on work. (31869942)
* Fix bug with tray app not setting agent in paused state during idle (31837900)
* Copy the tray app to a folder under C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local before running, so the agent can update without having to restart the tray app (which may be running under a different user account). (31815878)
* Use the agent's reported UpdateChannel property to choose which tool to use for updating the installation. ()
* Write the name of the channel to use for agent updates into the agent config file, and report it to the server through the agent properties. (31806993, 31810088)
* Separate implementations for regular user accounts from service accounts. (31802961)

(31618249)
* Add a new batch error code for agents that fail during syncing. (31576140)
