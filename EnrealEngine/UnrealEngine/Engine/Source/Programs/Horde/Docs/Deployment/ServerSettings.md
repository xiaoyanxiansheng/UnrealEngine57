# Server.json

All Horde-specific settings are stored in a root object called `Horde`. Other .NET functionality may be configured using properties in the root of this file.

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`runModes` | [RunMode](#runmode-enum)`[]`<br>Modes that the server should run in. Runmodes can be used in a multi-server deployment to limit the operations that a particular instance will try to perform.
`dataDir` | `string`<br>Override the data directory used by Horde. Defaults to C:\ProgramData\HordeServer on Windows, {AppDir}/Data on other platforms.
`installed` | `boolean`<br>Whether the server is running in 'installed' mode. In this mode, on Windows, the default data directory will use the common application data folder (C:\ProgramData\Epic\Horde), and configuration data will be read from here and the registry. This setting is overridden to false for local builds from appsettings.Local.json.
`httpPort` | `integer`<br>Main port for serving HTTP.
`httpsPort` | `integer`<br>Port for serving HTTP with TLS enabled. Disabled by default.
`http2Port` | `integer`<br>Dedicated port for serving only HTTP/2.
`mongoConnectionString` | `string`<br>Connection string for the Mongo database
`databaseConnectionString` | `string`<br>MongoDB connection string
`mongoDatabaseName` | `string`<br>MongoDB database name
`databaseName` | `string`<br>
`mongoPublicCertificate` | `string`<br>Optional certificate to trust in order to access the database (eg. AWS public cert for TLS)
`databasePublicCert` | `string`<br>
`mongoReadOnlyMode` | `boolean`<br>Access the database in read-only mode (avoids creating indices or updating content) Useful for debugging a local instance of HordeServer against a production database.
`databaseReadOnlyMode` | `boolean`<br>
`mongoMigrationsEnabled` | `boolean`<br>Whether database schema migrations are enabled
`mongoMigrationsAutoUpgrade` | `boolean`<br>Whether database schema should automatically be applied Only recommended for dev or test environments
`shutdownMemoryThreshold` | `integer`<br>Shutdown the current server process if memory usage reaches this threshold (specified in MB)<br>Usually set to 80-90% of available memory to avoid CLR heap using all of it. If a memory leak was to occur, it's usually better to restart the process rather than to let the GC work harder and harder trying to recoup memory.<br>Should only be used when multiple server processes are running behind a load balancer and one can be safely restarted automatically by the underlying process handler (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Supervisor etc). The shutdown behaves similar to receiving a SIGTERM and will wait for outstanding requests to finish.
`serverPrivateCert` | `string`<br>Optional PFX certificate to use for encrypting agent SSL traffic. This can be a self-signed certificate, as long as it's trusted by agents.
`authMethod` | [AuthMethod](#authmethod-enum)<br>Type of authentication (e.g anonymous, OIDC, built-in Horde accounts) If "Horde" auth mode is used, be sure to configure "ServerUrl" as well.
`oidcProfileName` | `string`<br>Optional profile name to report through the /api/v1/server/auth endpoint. Allows sharing auth tokens between providers configured through the same profile name in OidcToken.exe config files.

`oidcAudience` | `string`<br>Audience for validating externally issued tokens (required when OIDC is enabled)

`oidcClientSecret` | `string`<br>Client secret for authenticating with the OIDC provider. Note: If you need authentication support in Unreal Build Tool or Unreal Game Sync, configure your OIDC client as a public client (using PKCE flow without a client secret) instead of a confidential client. These tools utilize the EpicGames.OIDC library which only supports public clients with authorization code flow + PKCE.
`oidcSigninRedirect` | `string`<br>Optional redirect url provided to OIDC login
`oidcLocalRedirectUrls` | `string[]`<br>Optional redirect url provided to OIDC login for external tools (typically to a local server) Default value is the local web server started during signin by EpicGames.OIDC library
`oidcDebugMode` | `boolean`<br>Debug mode for OIDC which logs reasons for why JWT tokens fail to authenticate Also turns off HTTPS requirement for OIDC metadata fetching. NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!
`oidcRequestedScopes` | `string[]`<br>OpenID Connect scopes to request when signing in
`oidcClaimNameMapping` | `string[]`<br>List of fields in /userinfo endpoint to try map to the standard name claim (see System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.Name)

`oidcApiRequestedScopes` | `string[]`<br>API scopes to request when acquiring OIDC access tokens
`oidcAddDefaultScopesAndMappings` | `boolean`<br>Add common scopes and mappings to above OIDC config fields Provided as a workaround since .NET config will only *merge* array entries when combining multiple config sources. Due to this unwanted behavior, having hard-coded defaults makes such fields unchangeable. See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36569
`serverUrl` | `string`<br>Base URL this Horde server is accessible from For example https://horde.mystudio.com. If not set, a default is used based on current hostname. It's important this URL matches where users and agents access the server as it's used for signing auth tokens etc. Must be configured manually when running behind a reverse proxy or load balancer
`jwtIssuer` | `string`<br>Name of the issuer in bearer tokens from the server
`jwtExpiryTimeHours` | `integer`<br>Length of time before JWT tokens expire, in hours

`globalThreadPoolMinSize` | `integer`<br>Set the minimum size of the global thread pool This value has been found in need of tweaking to avoid timeouts with the Redis client during bursts of traffic. Default is 16 for .NET Core CLR. The correct value is dependent on the traffic the Horde Server is receiving. For Epic's internal deployment, this is set to 40.
`configPath` | `string`<br>Path to the root config file. Relative to the server.json file by default.

## RunMode (Enum)

Type of run mode this process should use. Each carry different types of workloads. More than one mode can be active. But not all modes are not guaranteed to be compatible with each other and will raise an error if combined in such a way.

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`None` | Default no-op value (ASP.NET config will default to this for enums that cannot be parsed)
`Server` | Handle and respond to incoming external requests, such as HTTP REST and gRPC calls. These requests are time-sensitive and short-lived, typically less than 5 secs. If processes handling requests are unavailable, it will be very visible for users.
`Worker` | Run non-request facing workloads. Such as background services, processing queues, running work based on timers etc. Short periods of downtime or high CPU usage due to bursts are fine for this mode. No user requests will be impacted directly. If auto-scaling is used, a much more aggressive policy can be applied (tighter process packing, higher avg CPU usage).
