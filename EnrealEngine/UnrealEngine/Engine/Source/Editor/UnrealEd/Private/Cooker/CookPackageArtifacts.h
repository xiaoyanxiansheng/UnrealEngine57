/**
 * A list of dependencies that affect the build of a BuildResult. BuildResults can be a package load, a package save,
 * or a system-specific set of data that is produced alongside the package load or save.
 *
 * In the build operation for the cook of a package, the load of the package is recorded as a BuildResult with no
 * payload (it has an implicit payload which is the loaded package as it exists in memory, but we do not store that
 * payload in the oplog). The dependencies for that BuildResult are the most commonly used source for transitive build
 * dependencies.
 * 
 * The second BuildResult in a package's cook is the bytes of the saved package. That BuildResult stores some of its
 * payload - the package bytes - as a special payload which is not stored in the BuildResult itself, but rather is
 * stored externally in the oplog. It stores the rest of its payload - the runtime dependencies - in the
 * FPackageArtifacts. The BuildDependencies of the save BuildResult are used to decide whether the package can be
 * incrementally skipped.
 *
 * System-specific BuildResults are not saved during the cook and each one must be recalculated on demand during the
 * cook by each dependent package that incorporates their data, and stored in the package data of the owning package
 * until it gets garbage collected and the data has to be recreated. The dependencies of that operation are stored in
 * the FPackageArtifacts for the owning package and can be used as a build dependency for the owning package and the
 * dependent packages.
 *
 * TODO: Add a system to preserve build results along with the dependencies.
