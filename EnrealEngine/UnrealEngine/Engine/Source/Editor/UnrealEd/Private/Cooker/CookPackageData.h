/**
 * Contains all the information the cooker uses for a package, during request, load, or save.  Once allocated, this
 * structure is never deallocated or moved for a given package; it is deallocated only when the CookOnTheFlyServer
 * is destroyed.
 *
 * PlatformDatas - Per-platform information about the package's cook state. Whether it has been marked reachable,
 *   whether it has been cooked and what the result was, etc.
 *   Direct write access to the platformdata is pseudo-private: it's available for convenience of the RequestCluster,
*    but when modifiying it the package may need to change state, so calling code should either update the state itself
*    or should call the functions on FPackageData that take a TargetPlatform and handle modifying the state.

 * Cooked platforms - Platforms are marked cooked if they have been saved in the lifetime of the 
 *   CookOnTheFlyServer; note this extends outside of the current CookOnTheFlyServer session for in-editor cooks.
 *   Cooked platforms also store the CookResults - success,error,other.
 *   Other: cooked platforms can be added to a PackageData for reasons other than normal Save, such as when a Package
 *   is marked not cookable for a Platform and its "Cooked" operation is therefore a noop.
 *   Cooked platforms can be cleared for a PackageData if the Package is modified, e.g. during editor operations
 *   when the CookOnTheFlyServer is run from the editor.
 *
 * Package - The package pointer corresponding to this PackageData.
 *   Contract for the lifetime of this field is that it is only set after the Package has passed through the load
 *   state, and it is cleared when the package returns to idle or is demoted to an earlier state.
 *   At all other times it is nullptr.
 *
 * State - the state of this PackageData in the CookOnTheFlyServer's current session. See the definition of
 *   EPackageState for a description of each state. Contract for the value of this field includes membership in the
 *   corresponding queue such as SaveQueue, and the presence or absence of state-specific data. Since modifying the
 *   State can put the Package into an invalid state, direct write access is private; SendToState handles enforcing
 *   the contracts.

 * PendingCookedPlatformData - a counter for how many objects in the package have had
 *   BeginCacheForCookedPlatformData called and have not yet completed. This is used to block the package from
 *   saving until all objects have finished their cache. It is also used to block the package from starting new
 *   BeginCacheForCookedPlatformData calls until all pending calls from a previous canceled save have completed.
 *   The lifetime of this counter extends for the lifetime of the PackageData; it is shared across
 *   CookOnTheFlyServer sessions.
 *
 * CookedPlatformDataNextIndex - Index for the next Object in CachedObjectsInOuter that needs to have
 *   BeginCacheForCookedPlatformData called on it for the current PackageSave. This field is only >= 0 during
 *   the save state; it is cleared to -1 when successfully or unsucessfully leaving the save state. 
 *
 * Other fields with explanation inline
