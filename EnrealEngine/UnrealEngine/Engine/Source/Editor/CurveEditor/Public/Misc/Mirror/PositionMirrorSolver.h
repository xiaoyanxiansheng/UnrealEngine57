/**
 * This class facilitates the movement of a dragged edge and recalculates the key heights for all specified keys.
 * The heights are linearly interpolated, ensuring that if the dragged edge crosses to the opposite side of the mirror edge,
 * the keys will flip to the other side.
 * 
 * Inputs:
 *  - Height of the dragged edge aligned to the x-axis
 *  - Height of the x-axis-aligned mirror edge
 *  - Keys originally located between the dragged and mirror edges
 *
 * Example:
 * Given a grid with a single key at a height 100, moving the top edge:
 *  - An equal distance past the bottom edge will result in a height of -100 for the key.
 *  - Halfway between the starting position and the bottom edge will result in a height of 50 for the key.
 * 
 * @note This class only recalculates key positions. To adjust the tangents of the keys use e.g. FTangentMirrorSolver.
