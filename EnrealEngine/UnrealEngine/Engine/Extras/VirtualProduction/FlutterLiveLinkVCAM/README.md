# live_link_vcam

A rebuild of the Live Link VCAM app for Flutter, enabling cross-platform deployment.

## Tentacle

This app depends on the `FlutterTentacle` package (included in the Unreal Engine repo under `Engine/Extras/Flutter/FlutterTentacle`), which in turn depends on the Tentacle SDK. The Tentacle SDK is not distributed to engine licensees. See the `FlutterTentacle` README for more info.

### IOS Note

Before building `live_link_vcam` for iOS, you will first need to run the `IOSSetup.sh` script as described in the `FlutterTentacle` README.

## Pigeon

This project uses Pigeon to automatically generate platform channel bindings for native APIs.
See `pigeons/README` for more information.
