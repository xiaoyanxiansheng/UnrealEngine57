/**
 * Generic controller that allows you to move the mouse while a command is pressed.
 * The sliding value is normalized to [-1,1] depending on whether the mouse was moved left or right.
 * 
 * The user must first press down the key chord for DragSliderCommand, and then the LMB. The user can press and release LMB multiple times while
 * DragSliderCommand's key chord is pressed down.
 * 
 * During sliding, the mouse is locked to the rect of the virtual slider: the area around where the user started dragging.
 * This is intended to give the user feedback when they've moved the mouse far enough to reach -1 or 1.
 * 
 * Example:
 * - Suppose MaxSlideWidthAttr returns 200, and that InDragSliderCommand is bound to U.
 * - The user presses U and moves the mouse
 *		- to right by 50 Slate units > OnSliderMovedDelegate is invoked with is 0.5.
 *		- to the right by 125 Slate units (exceeds the max sliding by 25 units) > OnSliderMovedDelegate is invoked with 1.0 (clamped).
 *		- to the left by 25 Slate units > OnSliderMovedDelegate is invoked with -0.25.
