/**
 * The training model base class.
 * This class is used to interface with Python by providing some methods you can call inside your python training code.
 * For example it allows you to get all the sampled data, such as the deltas, bones and curve values.
 * When you create a new model you need to create a class inherited from this base class, and define a Train method inside it as follows:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Doesn't need an implementation inside cpp, just a declaration in the header file.
 * UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = "Training Model")
 * int32 Train() const;
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Now inside your Python class you do something like:
 * 
 * @code{.py}
 * @unreal.uclass()
 * class YourModelPythonTrainingModel(unreal.YourTrainingModel):
 *     @unreal.ufunction(override=True)
 *     def train(self):
 *         # ...do training here...
 *         return 0   # A value of 0 is success, 1 means aborted, see ETrainingResult.
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The editor will execute the Train method, which will trigger the "train" method in your Python class to be executed.
 * Keep in mind that in Unreal Engine all python code is lower case. So a "Train" method inside c++ will need to be called "train" inside the python code.
 * Or if you have something called "PerformMyTraining" it will need to be called "perform_my_training" inside Python.
