/**
 * This class is an asset that can be created via the Content Browser and assigned to AUsdStageActors.
 *
 * Its main purpose is to track generated assets based on the hash of the source prim data: Whenever the AUsdStageActor needs
 * to generate e.g. a MaterialInstance, it will first hash the Material prim, and check whether its UUsdAssetCache3 already
 * has an asset of that class for the resulting hash.
 *
 * The cache can then be shared by multiple AUsdStageActors to prevent recreating UObjects from identical, already translated prim data.
 *
 * A "Default Asset Cache" can be set on the project settings, and will be automatically used for any AUsdStageActor that hasn't
 * had an asset cache manually set beforehand.
