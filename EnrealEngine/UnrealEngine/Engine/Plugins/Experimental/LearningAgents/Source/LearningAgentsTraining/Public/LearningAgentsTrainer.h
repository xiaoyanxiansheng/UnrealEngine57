	 *
	 * However, running training in non-editor builds can be very important - we probably want to disable rendering

	 * is simply may not be realistic to run it for a long time in play-in-editor.
	 *
	 * For this reason even in non-editor builds we let you provide the path where all of these editor-only things can
	 * be found. This allows you to run training when these things actually exist somewhere accessible to the executable,
	 * which will usually be the case on a normal development machine or cloud machine if it is set up that way.
	 *
	 * Since non-editor builds can be produced in a number of different ways, this is not set by default and cannot
	 * use a directory picker since it is relative to the final location of where your cooked, non-editor executable
	 * will exist rather than the current with-editor executable.
