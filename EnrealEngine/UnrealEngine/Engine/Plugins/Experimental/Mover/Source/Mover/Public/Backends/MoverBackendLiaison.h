/**
 * MoverBackendLiaisonInterface: any object or system wanting to be the driver of Mover actors must implement this. The intent is to act as a
 * middleman between the Mover actor and the system that drives it, such as the Network Prediction plugin.
 * In practice, objects implementing this interface should be some kind of UActorComponent. The Mover actor instantiates its backend liaison
 * when initialized, then relies on the liaison to call various functions as the simulation progresses. See @MoverComponent.
