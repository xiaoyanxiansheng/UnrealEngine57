	 * Sets a lock for all of TEDS systems. This is used whenever access to any data within TEDS is needed in a thread-safe manner. Shared 
	 * locks will allow multiple thread to safely read data, while exclusive locks provide safe read/write access.
	 * 
	 * The Global lock has an internal lock so shared locks can be freely handed out to requests with an internal scope. Exclusive 
	 * locks with the same scope will assert. This is meant to only be called by TEDS Core to lock the global lock for the duration of
	 * a processing phase. This is the only safe time to call it as all operations within a phase will be processed on all threads before
	 * a phase ends. If this is used for global calls it's possible that such a call is still processing when TEDS Core releases the lock
	 * and another exclusive lock is acquired. Therefore global locks fall back to full lock. Use global locks except from within adaptors
	 * that run in Mass processors.
	 * 
	 * The global lock uses internal reference counting to allow recursive calls from the same thread. Further state management also helps
	 * track incorrect requests for an exclusive lock on a thread that already has a shared lock. An assert triggers in this case to prevent
	 * deadlocks.
