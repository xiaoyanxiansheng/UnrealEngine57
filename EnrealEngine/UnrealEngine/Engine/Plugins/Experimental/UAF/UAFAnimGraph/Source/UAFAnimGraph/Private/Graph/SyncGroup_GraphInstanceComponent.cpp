// [Sync Group Details]
// Sequence synchronization is a complex topic, hopefully explained here in sufficient
// details to clarify what is going on.
// 
// UE synchronization is group based: players are assigned a group they belong to
// and they synchronize within that group. In order to do so, one member of the group
// is elected leader (@see FindLeaderIndex, @see EAnimGroupSynchronizationRole) while
// the rest are followers.
// 
// [Sync Group Name]
// Typically, when a graph is hand authored, a user specified group name will be used.
// This would be common for something like locomotion. However, sometimes we wish
// for things to synchronize together but not with re-entrant versions.
// Consider a blend space. We wish for its sequences to synchronize together. However
// if our parent node spawns a new instance of the blend space with different parameters
// we would like for each instance to NOT synchronize together. This is called
// self-synchronization: it is local only to the current instance. In a case like this,
// if we select a user supplied group name, then each instance will share the same
// group name and self-synchronization is not possible. To that end, unique group names
// can be generated and used for this. The parent node would be responsible for generating
// the unique group name (e.g. motion matching node) and to forward it to its children.
// 
// [Sync Group Mode]
// There are three sync group modes (@see EAnimGroupSynchronizationMode):
//    - No synchronization: disables synchronization
//    - Using group name: uses the user supplied group name to synchronize with other members
//    - Using unique group name: ignores any user supplied group name and generates a new
//      unique name for members to synchronize with
// 
// [Sync Group Method]
// There are two synchronization methods: time based and marker based. This is mostly
// dictated by the leader. If the leader has markers, everyone in the group will
// attempt to use them. Members without markers will revert to time based syncing.
// If the leader does not have markers, all members will use time based syncing.
// 
// [Sync Point Matching]
// When a new member joins a group, we need to determine where it starts playing.
// If we opt to match the sync point, we will make a best effort attempt to find a
// suitable start point as follows.
// 
// When a new leader joins an existing group, we first look at the old leader.
// If the old leader was using marker based syncing, then we use its old marker pair.
// If the old leader was using time based syncing (maybe it was alone in the group),
// we attempt to find the marker pair where it currently resides. We can only do so
// if the old leader is still a member of the current group. Once we have a valid
// marker pair for the old leader, we have two choices: match the phase or match
// the marker pair.
// 
// Matching the phase is most desirable but it has the strictest requirements. Phase
// matching allows the synchronization behavior to be deterministic: it doesn't matter
// when a member joins, it always ends up at the same phase even if it must loop to
// match. It works as follows:
//     - Find the marker pair of the leader (or old leader)
//       This pair comprises of: prev/next marker indices
//     - Collect all markers from the start of the sequence, up to our current pair
//     - The joining member can then skip each collected marker, in order, starting
//       from the start of the sequence.
// 
// For this to work, phase matching requires:
//     - Both sequences must begin with the same marker (e.g. both start with LeftFoot)
//     - Both sequences must have their markers in the same order (e.g. LRLR and LRLRLR)
// 
// When phase matching is not possible, we attempt to match the marker pair. We do so
// as follows:
//     - Find the marker pair of the leader (or old leader)
//       This pair comprises of: prev/next marker indices
//     - The joining member can then start searching for the closest marker pair
//       that matches. This could find a pair that is before/after the current position.
//       Non-matching markers will be skipped/ignored. As such, it is beneficial if
//       the new member has an approximate start position already set. If the pair
//       already matches then we can begin playing from nearby.
// 
// If the new leader joins an existing group and it does not use markers, then it
// will attempt to use the old leader's normalized play position like a time based
// follower would. Play then resumes at the same normalized position within the group.
// 
// If a new leader joins but it does NOT wish to match the sync point, it will snap
// the group to its current position (e.g. teleport/force update). When this occurs,
// all members of the group will be treated as if they have just joined and thus defer
// to their own sync point matching behavior.
// 
// Similarly, when a new follower joins a group, it can also attempt to match the sync
// point of the leader. To do so, it operates in the same way as a new leader would:
// we look for the leader's marker pair and we attempt to match the phase or the marker
// pair as described above. If we aren't using markers, then we match the normalized
// play position of the leader.
// 
// [Time Advancement]
// Group synchronization hijacks the normal graph time update in that players will not
// advance on their own. Instead, we must wait for all group members to be collected to
// begin synchronization.
// 
// Leaders will advance normally using their own delta time.
// 
// Followers will compute their own delta time based on how much the leader advanced.
// When markers are used, followers will attempt to pass the same markers passed by
// the leader to attempt to keep in phase (when possible). Unknown or mismatched markers
// will be skipped. The delta time computed is then the difference between where the
// follower was and where it should be within the new marker pair.
// When time based synchronization is used, we similarly compute our delta time based
// on where the follower was and where it should be based on the normalized play time
// of the leader.
// 
// Groups with a single member or un-grouped members advance normally without synchronization.
// 
// At times, a player will advance in time without playing events (e.g. notifies). This
// typically occurs when we need to snap to a position (e.g. when we join). When this occurs,
// we do not wish to fire events between our current and desired position. We always
// perform one advance that does trigger events for leaders. Followers never trigger events.
