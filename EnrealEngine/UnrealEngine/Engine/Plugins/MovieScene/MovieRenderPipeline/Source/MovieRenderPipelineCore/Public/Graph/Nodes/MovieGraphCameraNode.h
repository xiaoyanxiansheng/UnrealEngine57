	* frame and half the time after the frame. When set to FrameOpen, the motion represents the time from

	* Please note that using this feature might affect the results due to auto-exposure and other camera settings.
	* On EXR this will produce a 1080p image with extra pixel data hidden around the outside edges for use 
	* in post production. For all other formats this will increase the final resolution and no pixels will be hidden 
	* (ie: 1080p with 10.0 overscan will make a 2112x1188 jpg, but a 1080p exr /w 96/54 pixels hidden on each side).

	* of overscan in the engine (nDisplay).
