	/**
	* This class is responsible for blending a together a single Equirectangular Image from a series of individual
	* renders, and can blend multiple samples in a threadsafe way. For each incoming sample the pixel data should
	* contain information about panoramic pane (orientation, index, etc.), and one all samples have been called
	* BlendSample_AnyThread, it is safe for the owner of this instance to fetch the image data, which returns a
	* copy of the output image. You can then call Initialize() on it to reset the output image without reallocating
	* memory, which allows for reusing a given output blender for multiple frames.
	* 
	* This implementation works by allocating memory for each incoming sample that is the size of the data
	* once blended. Depending on where in the projection it is, different samples will take up different parts
	* of the output image (with different resolutions) so the pool stores available buffers by resolution.
	* Once a pool is either found or allocated for the sample, the incoming data is read from. Instead of taking
	* each sample in the incoming data and figuring out where it would go in the output image, we instead work backwards,
	* and calculate from each output pixel in the range that the sample would affect, sample the source image with filtering.
	* 
	* Once the blending into the temporary buffer is complete, a lock on the output array is taken and the data is added to
	* the output, and the buffer is returned to the pool.
